# Garden Tiles

## The Problem

**Summary**

Create a function to place tiles of varying sizes into a given area

**Conditions**

1.   Need to be create a valid arrangement of tiles
2.   Arrangement should contain an element of randomess, so that multiple arrangements can be generated
3.   Function should take an area and a set of tiles as an arguement and return a valid arrangement
4.   Ideally create a visualisation of the arrangement

## Content

**Experimentation**

This contains the notebook in which I built the initial functions and iterated to add features and fix bugs. I've cleaned up the code and commentented to show my thought process and how the function development has progressed. 

**Functions**

This contains the final functions I have written to solve the problem. There are two primary functions:

1. Placement - *This returns a numpy array of a placement of tiles*
2. Colour - *This uses the first function and returns an image of the tile placement*

There are also 2 variants of the functions:

1. Single_Size - *This should be used when all of your tiles are equally sized, there is an additional placement option available*
2. Multi_Size - *This should be used when you have tiles of varying sizes*

## Example

Currently the only example of using these functions can be found in the **Experimentation** Notebook.
